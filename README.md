## 🎯 Overview

SQLmap-like is a Python-based SQL Injection scanning tool inspired by sqlmap, developed as a university project. This educational tool replicates core functionalities of the popular SQLmap while offering flexibility, customization, and enhanced usability for penetration testers and ethical hackers. It also serves as a learning platform to understand SQL injection testing concepts. ⚠️ Use this tool responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission.

## Project Information

**Developed by:**
- Hezil Adem
- Omeiri Abdellah
- Rezig Nasim

This tool was created as an educational exercise to understand the mechanics of SQL injection testing and automated security assessment tools. While inspired by SQLmap, it serves as a learning implementation with a focused feature set.

---

## **Features**

- Supports both GET and POST HTTP methods.
- Multiple SQL Injection testing techniques (e.g., blind, union-based, and time-based).
- URL crawling to discover hidden endpoints.
- Proxy support for anonymity.
- User-Agent rotation.
- Export results in **JSON** or **HTML** formats.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ademoo077/SQLISSI

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SQLISSI

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Quick Start

Basic vulnerability scan:
```bash
python scanqli.py -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1" -p id
```

Advanced scan with all features:
```bash
python scanqli.py -u "http://target.com" -p id \
    --crawl --depth 3 \
    --tests union blind timebase \
    --threads 20 \
    --output scan_results.html
```

## Usage

Basic command structure:
```bash
python scanqli.py -u <target_url> -p <parameter> [options]
